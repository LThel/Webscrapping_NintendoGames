# TeamProject_NintendoGames
Project investigating Nintendo Games using python, web-scrapping and streamlit
You can run our streamlit for our presentation here : https://lthel-teamproject-nintendogames-streamlite-dashboard-doy09g.streamlit.app/

In this project we analyse the Nintendo games sales. 
  - The original dataset is available here (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/nintendo-games-dataset).
  - We will then add informations to it by web scrapping the vgchartz website (https://www.vgchartz.com) using libraries on Python.
  - All the data will be gathered, analysis and then we will build a dashboard using streamlit as a support to our final presentation.

**The team :**
